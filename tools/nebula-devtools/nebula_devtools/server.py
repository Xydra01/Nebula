"""Wire the ``test.run`` / ``build.run`` / ``lint.run`` tools to the language adapters.

Each call resolves the target language (explicit ``language`` argument wins, else auto-detect from
the worktree), applies the worktree-confinement guard, dispatches to the adapter verb, and builds
the MCP response: a first content block with the compact structured result and a second with the
raw log (which the host spills to a blob when over the cap). ``isError`` reflects the outcome.
