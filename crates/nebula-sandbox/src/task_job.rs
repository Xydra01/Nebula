//! The per-task Job Object wrapper (issue #30): one [`TaskJob`] per task, built on the audited
//! [`job`](crate::job) FFI surface.
//!
//! A [`TaskJob`] owns one kill-on-close Windows Job Object for a single task, applies the task's
//! optional memory and CPU limits before any member can run, and — when a memory limit is set —
//! associates an IO completion port and runs a background pump that turns the OS's
//! `JOB_OBJECT_MSG_*` notifications into a [`TerminationReason`] the executor can read. Dropping the
//! `TaskJob` closes the last handle, so the OS terminates the whole process tree (Requirement 5, 6).
//!
//! The `CURRENT_TASK_JOB` task-local and the `spawn_in_task_job` seam that `shell.run` / `git.*`
//! call live in `nebula-tools` (beside the `WorktreeRootProvider` they sit next to), not here, for
//! the same dependency-cycle reason the worktree provider does — see
//! [`crate::worktree::provider`]. This module provides the `TaskJob` the executor creates and the
//! seam spawns into.
