//! The one audited `unsafe` Win32 Job Object surface in the workspace (issue #30).
//!
//! This module owns every job-object FFI call Nebula makes: [`CreateJobObjectW`], [`SetInformationJobObject`],
//! [`AssignProcessToJobObject`], the job-handle [`CloseHandle`], the IO-completion-port calls
//! ([`CreateIoCompletionPort`]/[`GetQueuedCompletionStatus`]) used to learn *why* a member died,
//! and the `CREATE_SUSPENDED` + [`ResumeThread`] plumbing that assigns a child to its job before it
//! can run. No other module in the workspace declares these calls — `nebula-model` (its
//! per-process, daemon-lifetime model-server job) and `nebula-tools` (`shell.run` / `git.*` task
//! children, and the daemon-lifetime tool-server job) both build on this one surface rather than
//! keeping duplicate copies (Requirement 9).
//!
//! Per AGENTS.md, `unsafe` is denied everywhere except isolated modules like this one, and every
//! `unsafe` block carries a `// SAFETY:` comment stating the invariant it relies on.
//!
//! # Why a job per task
//!
//! A Windows Job Object groups processes: a child spawned by a member is itself a member (unless it
//! is explicitly allowed to break away, which this module never permits), and closing the last
//! handle to a job configured with [`JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`] terminates every member —
//! children and grandchildren alike — even if the owning process crashed. Assigning every process a
//! task starts to one per-task job therefore makes "cancel the task" and "the daemon died" both
//! reduce to "close the job handle", with no survivors (issue #30, Phase 1 exit criterion 3).
//!
//! # Breakaway is never permitted
//!
//! This module never sets `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_BREAKAWAY_OK` or `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_SILENT_BREAKAWAY_OK`,
//! so a descendant that passes `CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB` is denied and stays a member. Job
//! membership is thus inherited by the whole process tree at any depth (Requirement 3).

// This is the isolated, audited Win32 Job Object FFI surface; `unsafe` is allowed here (and only
// here, plus the model/tools launchers that will migrate to it) per AGENTS.md, with a `// SAFETY:`
// comment on every `unsafe` block.
