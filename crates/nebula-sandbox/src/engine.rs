//! The `RulesClassifier` engine: command segmentation, encoded/indirection detection, rule
//! matching with highest-tier-wins, and path-condition evaluation through the `Path_Resolver`
//! seam.
//!
//! This module implements the data-driven classifier that supersedes the issue #27
//! `DefaultClassifier`. It segments a command line, detects encoded/indirection sinks, matches
//! each segment against the embedded [`crate::rules::RulesTable`], resolves any path conditions
//! through a [`PathResolver`] seam, and takes the maximum tier over all segments. The result of
//! this pipeline is an internal [`Decision`] (a tier plus the id of the rule that produced it).
//!
//! The public [`CommandClassifier::classify`] and [`RulesClassifier::classify_with_magnitude`]
//! wrap the [`RulesClassifier::classify_decision`] pipeline with approval gating: for a tier above
//! [`NO_APPROVAL_THRESHOLD`] they consult the held [`ApprovalStore`] for an authorizing,
//! unconsumed, scope-valid grant and consume it when present. Each public classify call also emits
//! exactly one structured `permit.decision` tracing event recording the decision (task 7.1); see
//! [`RulesClassifier::log_decision`].
//!
//! # Decision logging and secrets (Req 6.5)
//!
//! Every `classify`/`classify_with_magnitude` call emits one `permit.decision` event carrying the
//! assigned `tier`, the matched `rule_id` (or the `"<no-match>"` sentinel), the `approval` outcome
//! (`permitted` | `escalated` | `refused`), the `command` **name**, and the `trace_id` read from
//! the active span. The event is secret-free **by construction**: the raw argument values are
//! never attached, so no secret-bearing argument (a token, password, or connection string) can
//! reach the event. The only attached string derived from the input is the command name, which is
//! not secret-bearing. Defensively, the central `nebula-telemetry` `NebulaLayer` additionally
//! masks any registered secret appearing in any attached string field when the telemetry
//! subscriber is installed, mirroring how `nebula-tools` logs `tool.call`. This keeps
//! `nebula-sandbox` dependency-light (no `nebula-telemetry` dependency) while still satisfying
//! Req 6.5.
//!
//! # The `Path_Resolver` seam (dependency direction)
//!
//! The real path resolver (`path::resolve`) lives in `nebula-tools`, and `nebula-tools` depends
//! on this crate — so this crate must **not** depend on `nebula-tools` (that would be a cycle).
//! The engine therefore resolves candidate paths through the [`PathResolver`] trait defined here,
//! and the daemon/`nebula-tools` can inject the real resolver via
//! [`RulesClassifier::with_resolver`]. [`RulesClassifier::embedded`] builds a built-in
//! [`LexicalResolver`] that performs **pure lexical** resolution (no filesystem I/O), which keeps
//! this crate FS-I/O-free and dependency-clean while remaining fully testable.
//!
//! # Protected set
//!
//! This is protected-set, security-sensitive policy (AGENTS.md hard rule 9). The engine performs
//! no filesystem I/O of its own — all path resolution is delegated to the injected
//! [`PathResolver`] — and never reads or writes the retired drive.
